        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India has made significant strides in satellite technology, particularly with projects like GSAT (Indian Communication Satellites) and NAVIC (India's Regional GPS System). These satellites have enhanced India's ability to predict weather, assist in navigation, and improve disaster management across the country.</p>

        <h2>Key Satellite Projects</h2>
        <p>India's satellite advancements, particularly through ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), have played a major role in several key areas. Two of the most important projects are GSAT and NAVIC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GSAT (Communication Satellites):</strong> The GSAT satellites provide crucial communication services across India, ensuring better connectivity for people in rural and remote areas. These satellites are used for telecommunication, television broadcasting, and broadband services.</li>

        <h2>Applications in Weather Prediction, Navigation, and Disaster Management</h2>
        <p>India’s satellites have had a profound impact on weather prediction, navigation, and disaster management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weather Prediction:</strong> GSAT satellites play a vital role in monitoring weather patterns and providing real-time data for weather forecasting. This helps meteorologists predict storms, rainfall, and other weather events, allowing for better preparedness across the country.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> NAVIC, with its highly accurate positioning system, aids in navigation for both everyday users and professionals. It provides accurate location data for transportation, navigation apps, and even for maritime and aviation operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Disaster Management:</strong> Satellites such as GSAT provide essential data during natural disasters, helping authorities track and manage the situation. They enable real-time communication and coordination in the aftermath of floods, earthquakes, and other disasters, ensuring faster and more effective responses.</li>
        </ul>
